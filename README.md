## Arquitecture
Project made with 100% python.

## To do
The counter does not work as the nonogram mechanics. Is only the total count of the row/column. 

## Configuration
At the start of the gen.py file, there're some variables that you can play with: 

At the moment there's only the square canvas option (so width == length)

**width:** Width of the canvas

**length:** Lenght of the canvas

**playMode (boolean):** Tells if you want to play (empty canvas) or just generate a solved puzzle (filled canvas).

## Run File
With Python 3 installed, run the file (windows versions):
```py
python gen.py
```
for those in UNIX-based OS, use the <code>python3</code> command
